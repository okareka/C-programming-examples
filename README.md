These programs are written so that the user can play with them by changing things around and extending them.

The included four examples of C programs are written for students who have taken C++ or another HLL but are hesitent in programming in C language.

In my opinion, C++ does not offer much more than C except shortcut to memory management - excluding libraries. But that is a great help in terms of security - particularly with Windows OS.

The code is not sophisticated - meaning, it does not do input or file verification. The only control is by setting maximum string and array sizes. String sizes and formatting will need changes to allow more diverse formats.

It has four programs that are at four levels:

Program 1: Hello World, not exhuastive by any means, but shows a few variants.

Program 2: Function call. Shows function prototypes, function definition and function calls.

Program 3: Multi-threading using a very simple example of reading a matrix row by row and printing it column by column.

Program 4: A more elaborate, yet only about 400 lines program to show the use of C stdlib functions for quick sort and linear search.
